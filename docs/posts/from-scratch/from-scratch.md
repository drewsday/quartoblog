# Can I make a post to the gh-pages blog from scratch?

(This is really a test as to whether or not I ended up setting up the
blog with gh-pages correctly.)

# Heading test

Next, I really want to just test my understanding of markdown.

## Subheading test

Let’s make a bulleted list: 
- Item 1 
- Item 2 
- Item c 
- There is no Item 4

Let’s try the other type of bulleted list:
 - Item a
 - Item b
 - Item 3
 - Item d

What if I really wanted to quote something here: \
> To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea
of troubles And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep, No more; and by a
sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That
flesh is heir to: ’tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish’d.

Now I want to try a numbered list: 
1. Bread 
1. Milk 
1. Flour 
1. Butter 
1. Cheese 
    1. Havarti 
    1. Mozzarella 
    1. Gruyere 
1. Beer 
    1. Budweiser 
    1. New Belgium 
        1. Fat Tire 
        2. Voodoo Ranger 
            1. Voodoo Ranger IPA 
            1. Voodoo Ranger Imperial 
            1. Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze 
        1. Old Tuffy 
        1. Trippel 
        1. 1554 
    1. Coors

### Subheading test

If I was clever, I would insert an image here as a test.

#### 4th level subheading test

What else can I test here? *** I can make things **bold** or *italic*.
*** I can insert an equation: $\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$
